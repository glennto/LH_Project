**Addendum to Lathe Helper Project**



02/13/2021  A new folder, *Test* has been added to the repository.  Included in this folder is an Arduino program *rpm_test.ino*  provided for the sole purpose of detecting spindle rpm pulses and computing and displaying an rpm value, both on an LCD screen and on the Arduino IDE serial monitor.  This could be used as an independent means of verifying any rpm sensor implementation. This program does not form a part of the operational Lathe Helper Display project.

12/22/2023 There is a DIY project on Thingiverse (Search 'MachTach') that has a bearing on this project. While the MachTach design is functionally simpler than the Lathe Helper, the author has written an outstandingly detailed Operations Manual where you can find excellent information about constructing and installing a number of different types of machine (lathe, milling, drill press, etc) rpm sensors - any of which would be applicable to this project.
